 # My Faith

 ## What is my Faith?
 
(For a quick and dirty summary, see [[The Apostles' Creed]].)

"[[Faith]]" is a technical term meaning "belief that changes what you think, feel, and do." Here is a short explanation of mine.

## [[Christianity]] and [[The Bible]]

I am a [[Christianity|Christian]]. I believe that [[God]] is real. I believe he [[Creation|created]] the entire [[The Universe]].

I believe that the Christian scriptures (aka, "[[The Bible]]") contain [[Inspiration|God's actual writings]]. I believe [[God]] wants humans to know about and believe [[The Gospel|the message]] that is in [[The Bible|his book]].

[[The Bible]] teaches that all humans are born with [[Sickness|a terminal disease]]. (All except three, that is—but two of those three were Patients 0 and 1, respectively. Their names were Adam and Eve.) The disease is not genetic. But it is hereditary, and there is no natural cure.

This illness has a **100% mortality rate**, and YOU have it, because your parents had it. The presenting symptom of this disease: *wanting to stay sick.*

This disease is called [[Sin]].

## The Problem: [[Sin]]

[[The Bible]] teaches that [[Sin]] is hating the [[God]] who made you and wanting to [[Idolatry|replace him]]—usually with [[Self-Idolatry|yourself]] somehow. But sinful hearts aren't picky—any replacement will do.

This is *irrational*—that means it defies [[Reason]]. It is like a leaf hating its own tree. Or a flower seething with hatred toward the sun. We need [[God]] to exist at all—but, irrationally, we HATE him.

[[God]] is really, really [[The Good|good]]. He didn't have to [[Creation|make]] anything. But he did, and he made it wonderful. You are an incredible work of art. [[God]] made you.

[[God]] does not deserve our hate. He deserves our love. We are in the wrong.

[[The Bible]] teaches that [[God]] would uphold [[Justice]] if he [[Hell|infinitely punished]] Sinners (i.e. us) forever. He is infinitely [[The Good|good]], making offense against him infinitely [[Evil|bad]].

But [[God]] *delights* in being merciful. He knows that [[Sin]] is a sickness, and he *loves* to heal people who are sick.

This presents a quandary. [[Justice]] is clear: those who hate and [[Idolatry|replace God]] deserve to *get what they want*—which is to be cut off from the source of all [[The Good|good]] and spend eternity growing [[Hell|more and more dead]], like a flower that hates the sun.

Can [[God]] heal sinners AND uphold [[Justice]]?

The shocking resolution to this quandary is "Yes!"—but not in a way anyone expected.

## The Solution: Jesus

[[Jesus Christ]] was a human man who lived 2,000 years ago in Israel. He was (and is) [[God The Son|God's own Son]], who is himself [[God]]. [[God The Father]] sent him from [[Heaven]] to make a way for Sinners (that's us) to be [[Salvation|saved]] from [[Sin]] and [[Death]].

[[The Bible]] teaches that [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] took full punishment for [[Sin]] on himself to satisfy [[God]]'s [[Justice]]. And he lived a perfect, [[Sin]]-less life to fulfill the righteousness that we failed to live up to. He [[The Crucifixion|died on a Roman cross]], betrayed by his own people, naked, ashamed, and alone.

Just like [[God]] does not deserve our hatred, [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] did not deserve to be punished for [[Sin]]. But he willingly and knowingly took that punishment in order to pay the rightful penalty of [[Sin]] in the place of the Sinners (that's us) who actually earned it.

On the third day after his death, [[God]] raised [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] back to life. The [[The Bible|Bible]]'s word for this is "[[Resurrection]]." This proved [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]' innocence, confirmed his  [[Identity]] as [[God]], and declared him with power to be [[God The Son|who he claimed to be]]. [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] ascended into [[Heaven]] and took the ruling seat over the entire [[The Universe|Universe]]. He's still there today.

[[The Bible]] teaches that [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] then sent [[God the Holy Spirit|The Holy Spirit]], who is also himself [[God]], to grant [[Faith]] to Sinners (that's us), to live in their hearts, and through [[Faith]] to make them [[Union With Christ|Identify]] with [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]. [[Identity]] with [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] means that his punishment for [[Sin]] (which he didn't commit) covers their debt, and his righteous life [[Union With Christ|becomes theirs too]].

This is a spiritual [[Resurrection]] exactly as [[Miracle|Miraculous]] as [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]' own rising from the dead. In fact, our spiritual [[Resurrection]] is, in a real sense, a direct continuation of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]' physical one. The two events are deeply connected to one another.

## The Message of the Gospel

[[The Bible]] teaches that Sinners—that means anyone who has this terminal disease which makes them hate [[God]] and *want* to never get better—have exactly **one hope** to not [[Death|die]] eternally for good:

[[The Bible]] teaches that YOU need to believe that [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] was telling the truth. You need to admit your [[Sin]], reject it, and [[Repentance|throw it away]]. You need to ask [[God]] to give you [[Faith]] and make your life united to [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]' life. You need to submit to [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] as your King. If you do, then his payment covers your [[Sin|crimes]], you are no longer [[God]]'s enemy, and you will [[Eternal Life|live forever]] in  [[Heaven]] [[Union With Christ|with him]] (this is a [[Christian Hedonism|very, very good]] way to spend eternity). This [[The Gospel|Gospel]] (which means "good news") is the **one hope** for *all people everywhere*.

Life is very short. And it only ends one of two ways: either you [[Death|die]], or [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] comes back first. Either way, the window of opportunity to accept this hope—that is, to believe in this [[The Gospel|Gospel]] and be [[Salvation|saved]] from [[Sin]] and [[Death]]—is closing awfully soon. After that point, it will be too late. [[Death]] forever will be all that's left.

Make no mistake: [[God]] will serve [[Justice]] ultimately. Even foolish humans don't just let murderers go free. Neither will [[God]] just forget the wrong we do, to him and to each other.

Either [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]' life and sacrificial death is covering your [[Sin]], or [[Sin]] is still on you and you are in real [[Hell|danger]]. Time *will* tell. I hope you won't wait!

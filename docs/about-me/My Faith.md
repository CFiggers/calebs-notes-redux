# My Faith

### **What is my Faith?**

(For a quick and dirty summary,
see <a href="https://brick.do/rvPmAA6e7Noa" class="page-link">The Apostles' Creed</a>.)

"<a href="https://brick.do/WbMLZvjBjx4E" class="page-link">Faith</a>" is
a technical term meaning "belief that changes what you think, feel, and
do." Here is a short explanation of mine.

### <a href="https://brick.do/k8g6Bg2loJQo" class="page-link">Christianity</a>** and **<a href="https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o" class="page-link">The Bible</a>

I am a
[Christian](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/christianity-k8g6Bg2loJQo). I
believe
that <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> is
real. I believe he
[created](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/creation-P6Denm5RQdzn) the entire
[Universe](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-universe-wMV8qe9GVV7j).

I believe that the Christian scriptures (aka, "<a href="https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o" class="page-link">The Bible</a>") contain [God's actual writings](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/inspiration-x1nz8nqJpoZV). I believe <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> wants humans to know about and believe [the message](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-gospel-BAJ0dWx2AV8b) that is in [his book](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-bible-L5D2L2nMpe8o).

<a href="https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o" class="page-link">The Bible</a> teaches
that all humans are born with [a terminal
disease](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/sickness-y6RVm2xMDLdb). (All
except three, that is—but two of those three were Patients 0 and 1,
respectively. Their names were Adam and Eve.) The disease is not
genetic. But it is hereditary, and there is no natural cure.

This illness has a **100% mortality rate**, and YOU have it, because
your parents had it. The presenting symptom of this disease: *wanting to
stay sick.*

This disease is
called <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>.

### **The Problem: **<a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>

<a href="https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o" class="page-link">The Bible</a> teaches
that <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> is
hating
the <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> who
made you and wanting to [replace
him](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/idolatry-GdVm4jx07PvD)—usually with
[yourself](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/self-idolatry-1XgyW6nrjzyD)
somehow. But sinful hearts aren't picky—any replacement will do.

This is *irrational*—that means it
defies <a href="https://brick.do/z0b4y4o7ZZXA" class="page-link">Reason</a>.
It is like a leaf hating its own tree. Or a flower seething with hatred
toward the sun. We
need <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> to
exist at all—but, irrationally, we HATE him.

<a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> is
really, really
[good](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-good-6nDYE3kQmB25). He didn't
have to [make](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/creation-P6Denm5RQdzn)
anything. But he did, and he made it wonderful. You are an incredible
work of
art. <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> made
you.

<a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> does
not deserve our hate. He deserves our love. We are in the wrong.

<a href="https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o" class="page-link">The Bible</a> teaches
that <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> would
uphold <a href="https://brick.do/3aAarApjVel7" class="page-link">Justice</a> if
he [infinitely punished](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/hell-rJok9eyQGLn6)
Sinners (i.e. us) forever. He is infinitely
[good](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-good-6nDYE3kQmB25), making
offense against him infinitely
[bad](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/evil-RXp7W46Nq8LA).

But <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> *delights*
in being merciful. He knows
that <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> is
a sickness, and he *loves* to heal people who are sick.

This presents a
quandary. <a href="https://brick.do/3aAarApjVel7" class="page-link">Justice</a> is
clear: those who hate and [replace
God](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/idolatry-GdVm4jx07PvD) deserve to *get
what they want*—which is to be cut off from the source of all
[good](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-good-6nDYE3kQmB25) and spend
eternity growing [more and more
dead](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/hell-rJok9eyQGLn6), like a flower
that hates the sun.

Can <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> heal
sinners AND
uphold <a href="https://brick.do/3aAarApjVel7" class="page-link">Justice</a>?

The shocking resolution to this quandary is "Yes!"—but not in a way
anyone expected.

### **The Solution: Jesus**

<a href="https://brick.do/eLn0ya3z9rXy" class="page-link">Jesus Christ</a> was
a human man who lived 2,000 years ago in Israel. He was (and is) [God's
own Son](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/god-the-son-22JRbEvL02mM), who is
himself <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>. <a href="https://brick.do/3QYyVl093xzw" class="page-link">God The Father</a> sent
him
from <a href="https://brick.do/gZ618XlK2xd5" class="page-link">Heaven</a> to
make a way for Sinners (that's us) to be
[saved](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/salvation-0mP8w8mKDKZy)
from <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> and <a href="https://brick.do/8oeKL6pKdJXw" class="page-link">Death</a>.

<a href="https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o" class="page-link">The Bible</a> teaches
that [Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy)
took full punishment
for <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> on
himself to
satisfy <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>'s <a href="https://brick.do/3aAarApjVel7" class="page-link">Justice</a>.
And he lived a
perfect, <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>-less
life to fulfill the righteousness that we failed to live up to. He [died
on a Roman
cross](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-crucifixion-KXlVk44ggWwd),
betrayed by his own people, naked, ashamed, and alone.

Just
like <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> does
not deserve our hatred,
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy) did not
deserve to be punished
for <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>.
But he willingly and knowingly took that punishment in order to pay the
rightful penalty
of <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> in
the place of the Sinners (that's us) who actually earned it.

On the third day after his
death, <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> raised
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy) back to
life. The [Bible](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-bible-L5D2L2nMpe8o)'s
word for this is
"<a href="https://brick.do/wJanx0bEMgVM" class="page-link">Resurrection</a>."
This proved
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy)'
innocence, confirmed
his <a href="https://brick.do/23X25X7Vw1pb" class="page-link">Identity</a> as <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>,
and declared him with power to be [who he claimed to
be](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/god-the-son-22JRbEvL02mM).
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy) ascended
into <a href="https://brick.do/gZ618XlK2xd5" class="page-link">Heaven</a> and
took the ruling seat over the entire
[Universe](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-universe-wMV8qe9GVV7j). He's
still there today.

<a href="https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o" class="page-link">The Bible</a> teaches
that [Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy)
then sent [The Holy
Spirit](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/god-the-holy-spirit-o4MxaNb7JmEm),
who is also
himself <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>,
to
grant <a href="https://brick.do/WbMLZvjBjx4E" class="page-link">Faith</a> to
Sinners (that's us), to live in their hearts, and
through <a href="https://brick.do/WbMLZvjBjx4E" class="page-link">Faith</a> to
make them
[Identify](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/union-with-christ-mOKYkZ4xvn81)
with
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy). <a href="https://brick.do/23X25X7Vw1pb" class="page-link">Identity</a> with
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy) means
that his punishment
for <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> (which
he didn't commit) covers their debt, and his righteous life [becomes
theirs
too](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/union-with-christ-mOKYkZ4xvn81).

This is a
spiritual <a href="https://brick.do/wJanx0bEMgVM" class="page-link">Resurrection</a> exactly
as [Miraculous](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/miracle-o5zXnoYlGkOx) as
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy)' own
rising from the dead. In fact, our
spiritual <a href="https://brick.do/wJanx0bEMgVM" class="page-link">Resurrection</a> is,
in a real sense, a direct continuation of
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy)'
physical one. The two events are deeply connected to one another.

### **The Message of the Gospel**

<a href="https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o" class="page-link">The Bible</a> teaches
that Sinners—that means anyone who has this terminal disease which makes
them
hate <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> and
*want* to never get better—have exactly **one hope** to not
[die](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/death-8oeKL6pKdJXw) eternally for
good:

<a href="https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o" class="page-link">The Bible</a> teaches
that YOU need to believe that
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy) was
telling the truth. You need to admit
your <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>,
reject it, and [throw it
away](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/repentance-zPeOjaXlG5x3). You need to
ask <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> to
give
you <a href="https://brick.do/WbMLZvjBjx4E" class="page-link">Faith</a> and
make your life united to
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy)' life.
You need to submit to
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy) as your
King. If you do, then his payment covers your
[crimes](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/sin-46dMY0LDO1aZ), you are no
longer <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>'s
enemy, and you will [live
forever](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/eternal-life-mDlGVO2Q7qyp)
in <a href="https://brick.do/gZ618XlK2xd5" class="page-link">Heaven</a> [with
him](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/union-with-christ-mOKYkZ4xvn81) (this
is a [very, very
good](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/christian-hedonism-anDrZbm37eJv) way
to spend eternity). This
[Gospel](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-gospel-BAJ0dWx2AV8b) (which
means "good news") is the **one hope** for *all people everywhere*.

Life is very short. And it only ends one of two ways: either you
[die](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/death-8oeKL6pKdJXw), or
[Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy) comes
back first. Either way, the window of opportunity to accept this
hope—that is, to believe in this
[Gospel](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-gospel-BAJ0dWx2AV8b) and be
[saved](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/salvation-0mP8w8mKDKZy)
from <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> and <a href="https://brick.do/8oeKL6pKdJXw" class="page-link">Death</a>—is
closing awfully soon. After that point, it will be too
late. <a href="https://brick.do/8oeKL6pKdJXw" class="page-link">Death</a> forever
will be all that's left.

Make no
mistake: <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> will
serve <a href="https://brick.do/3aAarApjVel7" class="page-link">Justice</a> ultimately.
Even foolish humans don't just let murderers go free. Neither
will <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> just
forget the wrong we do, to him and to each other.

Either [Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/jesus-christ-eLn0ya3z9rXy)'
life and sacrificial death is covering
your <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>,
or <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> is
still on you and you are in real
[danger](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/hell-rJok9eyQGLn6). Time *will*
tell. I hope you won't wait!

 # My Faith

 ## **What is my Faith?**
 
(For a quick and dirty summary, see [The Apostles' Creed](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Apostles%20Creed.md).)

"[Faith](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Faith.md)" is a technical term meaning "belief that changes what you think, feel, and do." Here is a short explanation of mine.

## [Christianity](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity.md) and [The Bible](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md)

I am a [Christian](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity.md). I believe that [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) is real. I believe he [created](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Creation.md) the entire [The Universe](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/The%20Universe.md).

I believe that the Christian scriptures (aka, "[The Bible](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md)") contain [God's actual writings](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Inspiration.md). I believe [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) wants humans to know about and believe [the message](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Gospel.md) that is in [his book](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md).

[The Bible](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md) teaches that all humans are born with [a terminal disease](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Sickness.md). (All except three, that is—but two of those three were Patients 0 and 1, respectively. Their names were Adam and Eve.) The disease is not genetic. But it is hereditary, and there is no natural cure.

This illness has a **100% mortality rate**, and YOU have it, because your parents had it. The presenting symptom of this disease: *wanting to stay sick.*

This disease is called [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md).

## **The Problem: [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md)**

[The Bible](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md) teaches that [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md) is hating the [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) who made you and wanting to [replace him](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Idolatry.md)—usually with [yourself](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Idolatry/Self-Idolatry.md) somehow. But sinful hearts aren't picky—any replacement will do.

This is *irrational*—that means it defies [Reason](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Reason.md). It is like a leaf hating its own tree. Or a flower seething with hatred toward the sun. We need [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) to exist at all—but, irrationally, we HATE him.

[God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) is really, really [good](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/The%20Good.md). He didn't have to [make](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Creation.md) anything. But he did, and he made it wonderful. You are an incredible work of art. [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) made you.

[God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) does not deserve our hate. He deserves our love. We are in the wrong.

[The Bible](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md) teaches that [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) would uphold [Justice](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Justice.md) if he [infinitely punished](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Hell.md) Sinners (i.e. us) forever. He is infinitely [good](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/The%20Good.md), making offense against him infinitely [bad](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Evil.md).

But [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) *delights* in being merciful. He knows that [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md) is a sickness, and he *loves* to heal people who are sick.

This presents a quandary. [Justice](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Justice.md) is clear: those who hate and [replace God](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Idolatry.md) deserve to *get what they want*—which is to be cut off from the source of all [good](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/The%20Good.md) and spend eternity growing [more and more dead](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Hell.md), like a flower that hates the sun.

Can [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) heal sinners AND uphold [Justice](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Justice.md)?

The shocking resolution to this quandary is "Yes!"—but not in a way anyone expected.

## **The Solution: Jesus**

[Jesus Christ](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md) was a human man who lived 2,000 years ago in Israel. He was (and is) [God's own Son](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son.md), who is himself [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md). [God The Father](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Father.md) sent him from [Heaven](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Heaven.md) to make a way for Sinners (that's us) to be [saved](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Salvation.md) from [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md) and [Death](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Death.md).

[The Bible](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md) teaches that [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md) took full punishment for [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md) on himself to satisfy [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md)'s [Justice](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Justice.md). And he lived a perfect, [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md)-less life to fulfill the righteousness that we failed to live up to. He [died on a Roman cross](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Crucifixion.md), betrayed by his own people, naked, ashamed, and alone.

Just like [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) does not deserve our hatred, [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md) did not deserve to be punished for [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md). But he willingly and knowingly took that punishment in order to pay the rightful penalty of [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md) in the place of the Sinners (that's us) who actually earned it.

On the third day after his death, [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) raised [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md) back to life. The [Bible](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md)'s word for this is "[Resurrection](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Resurrection.md)." This proved [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md)' innocence, confirmed his  [Identity](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Identity.md) as [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md), and declared him with power to be [who he claimed to be](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son.md). [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md) ascended into [Heaven](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Heaven.md) and took the ruling seat over the entire [Universe](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-universe-wMV8qe9GVV7j). He's still there today.

[The Bible](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md) teaches that [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md) then sent [The Holy Spirit](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/god-the-holy-spirit-o4MxaNb7JmEm), who is also himself [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md), to grant [Faith](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Faith.md) to Sinners (that's us), to live in their hearts, and through [Faith](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Faith.md) to make them [Identify](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/union-with-christ-mOKYkZ4xvn81) with [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md). [Identity](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Identity.md) with [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md) means that his punishment for [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md) (which he didn't commit) covers their debt, and his righteous life [becomes theirs too](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/union-with-christ-mOKYkZ4xvn81).

This is a spiritual [Resurrection](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Resurrection.md) exactly as [Miraculous](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Miracle.md) as [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md)' own rising from the dead. In fact, our spiritual [Resurrection](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Resurrection.md) is, in a real sense, a direct continuation of [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md)' physical one. The two events are deeply connected to one another.

## **The Message of the Gospel**

[The Bible](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md) teaches that Sinners—that means anyone who has this terminal disease which makes them hate [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) and *want* to never get better—have exactly **one hope** to not [die](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Death.md) eternally for good:

[The Bible](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Bible.md) teaches that YOU need to believe that [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md) was telling the truth. You need to admit your [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md), reject it, and [throw it away](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Repentance.md). You need to ask [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) to give you [Faith](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Faith.md) and make your life united to [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md)' life. You need to submit to [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md) as your King. If you do, then his payment covers your [crimes](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md), you are no longer [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md)'s enemy, and you will [live forever](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Eternal%20Life.md) in  [Heaven](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Heaven.md) [with him](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Union%20with%20Christ.md) (this is a [very, very good](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Schools%20of%20Thought/Christian%20Hedonism.md) way to spend eternity). This [Gospel](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Gospel.md) (which means "good news") is the **one hope** for *all people everywhere*.

Life is very short. And it only ends one of two ways: either you [die](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Death.md), or [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md) comes back first. Either way, the window of opportunity to accept this hope—that is, to believe in this [Gospel](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/The%20Gospel.md) and be [saved](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Salvation.md) from [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md) and [Death](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Death.md)—is closing awfully soon. After that point, it will be too late. [Death](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Death.md) forever will be all that's left.

Make no mistake: [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) will serve [Justice](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Concepts/Justice.md) ultimately. Even foolish humans don't just let murderers go free. Neither will [God](../life-universe-everything/God.md) just forget the wrong we do, to him and to each other.

Either [Jesus](../life-universe-everything/God/God%20The%20Son/Jesus%20Christ.md)' life and sacrificial death is covering your [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md), or [Sin](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Sin.md) is still on you and you are in real [danger](../life-universe-everything/Everything%20Else/Areas%20of%20Study/Christianity/Hell.md). Time *will* tell. I hope you won't wait!

# Caleb's Notes

Hi there! I'm [[About Me|Caleb]] ðŸ‘‹

This personal website is a spot for me to share random stuff that I'm thinking about or working on.Â It has three major sections:

- [Notes](/): That's this section, the one you're reading right now. Roughly speaking, a Knowledge Garden.
- [Guides](/guides): How-to's and Beginner Introductions to a few of the tools and technologies I use a lot.
- [Blog](/blog): Time-bound stuffâ€”e.g., ideas I'm contemplating, dev logs for projects I'm working on, and problems I'm in the middle of solving. 

## What can you find here?

The sidebar (ðŸ‘ˆ) has some top-level pages to help me organize this mess.

-   [[What's New]]Â is an inconsistently-updated Changelog of this website to help document what I've been devoting attention to recently.
-   Learn about me underÂ [[About Me]].
-   The biggest section of this "Notes" area isÂ [[life-universe-everything|Life, the Universe, and Everything]], an exercise inÂ [[Thinking in Public]]Â about...Â everything I can. You might call it a [[Digital Gardening|digital garden]]. Almost all of the pages in there are placeholders with no content (yet).
-   [[Things I've Made]]Â serves as a convenient place to link to when I make stuff other places (likeÂ [[GitHub]]Â or Twitter).
-   Finally,Â [[resources|Resource Library]]Â is forÂ sharing recommended books, YouTube videos, podcast episodes, and other resources that I've benefitted from (and some of them have commentary as well).

## New here?

Here's some stuff I like to [[Thinking|think]] and [[Writing|write]] about to get you started exploring:

-   [[My Faith]]Â (namely,Â [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Reformed BaptistÂ [[Christianity]])
-   [[Category Theory]]
-   [[Programming]]Â and [[Languages (Programming)|Programming Languages]]
    -   [[AutoHotkey]]
    -   [[Clojure]]
    -   [[Haskell]]
-   [[Personal Knowledge Management]]
    -   [[Roam Research]]
-   [[Theology]]
-   [[Philosophy]]
-   [[Surviving Seminary]]

Here's some [[My Hobbies|hobbies]] and some [[Media|media]] that I enjoy.

## Brewing Ideas

- [ ] Why I loveÂ [[AutoHotkey]]Â so much,Â and how I use it together withÂ [[Roam Research]]Â andÂ [[VS Code]]Â for myÂ [[Personal Knowledge Management]]Â workflow
- [ ] What's so troublesome aboutÂ [[Platonism]]Â as a Christian [[Metaphysics|Metaphysic]] and why I prefer (and thinkÂ [[The Bible]]Â is more consistent with) something more like Hebraic Covenantalism
- [ ] Why EVERYONE should learn basicÂ [[Category Theory]] and therefore why we should teach it in schoolsÂ 
- [ ] Why anyone who aspires to clear thinking, reasoning, and communicating should learnÂ [[Haskell]]Â (especially ChristianÂ [[Theologians]]Â and students of theÂ [[Divinities]]
- [ ] Listening carefully toÂ [[Daniel Schmachtenberger]]Â on a variety of topics:
    - Being, Doing, Becoming
    - [[Compassion]]Â andÂ [[Compersion]]Â vsÂ [[Sadism]]Â andÂ [[Envy]] 
    - Better metrics for assessing the state of society
    - First-, Second-, and Third-Person [[Epistemology|Epistemics]]
    - TheÂ [[Hegelian Dialectic]]Â and Seeking Synthesis through Rigorous Empathy
- [ ] The concept ofÂ [[The Liberal Arts]]Â as those skills which members of a free society need to be successful (and which a free society needs its members to have to be successful itself)
- [ ] Why the termÂ [[Position]]Â is useful for expressing the [[Abstraction|generic concept]] of one's intellectual assent and convicted commitment to supporting an idea, belief, or decision
- [ ] Why "[[Character]]" is a more useful and less error-prone concept than "[[Essence]]" when it comes to seeking and communicating our grasp of the behavior, quality, or "is-ness" of a thing
- [ ] How Symbols andÂ [[Typology]]Â serve as proving grounds for our understanding ofÂ [[Truth]]Â andÂ [[Meaning]]Â (and howÂ [[Category Theory]]Â clarifies the whole project)
- [ ] Learning [[Clojure]], and some thoughts that has provoked about language andÂ [[Learning]]Â in general

# Caleb's Notes

Hi there! I'm [Caleb](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/about-me-Z2kPDq06zlXe) ðŸ‘‹

This personal website is a spot for me to share random stuff that I'm thinking about or working on.Â It has three major sections:

- [Notes](/): That's this section, the one you're reading right now. Roughly speaking, a Knowledge Garden.
- [Guides](/guides): How-to's and Beginner Introductions to a few of the tools and technologies I use a lot.
- [Blog](/blog): Time-bound stuffâ€”e.g., ideas I'm contemplating, dev logs for projects I'm working on, and problems I'm in the middle of solving. 

### What can you find here?

The sidebar (ðŸ‘ˆ) has some top-level pages to help me organize this mess.

-   [What's New](https://brick.do/pg221pWYODbp)Â is an inconsistently-updated Changelog of this website to help document what I've been devoting attention to recently.
-   Learn about me underÂ [About Me](https://brick.do/Z2kPDq06zlXe).
-   The biggest section of this "Notes" area isÂ [Life, the Universe, and Everything](https://brick.do/KEyEmqxvEQWa), an exercise inÂ [Thinking in Public](https://brick.do/vBA8Dk7lJ6G7)Â about...Â everything I can. You might call it a [digital garden](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/digital-gardening-PNgBZy03plvM). Almost all of the pages in there are placeholders with no content (yet).
-   I put more traditional "blog post"-style write-ups (like How-To guides and soapbox rant opinion pieces) underÂ [Topics](https://brick.do/bEoP6nNyEaO7).
-   [Things I've Learned](https://brick.do/KjJRV1oB8enO)Â is forÂ [Evergreen Notes](https://brick.do/WdGrybq34RqM)â€”that is, ideas I'm personally convinced are valuable and applicable to many areas of life.
-   Finally,Â [Things I've Made](https://brick.do/DBnEKoXGQOwy)Â serves as a convenient place to link to when I make stuff other places (likeÂ [GitHub](https://brick.do/2b5Y6zNym1BW)Â or Twitter).

### New here?

Here's some stuff I like to [think](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/thinking-X90XApqY3ow2) and [write](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/writing-KL3En8JRYMvz) about to get you started exploring:

-   [Category Theory](https://brick.do/vV4KxM2bqG20)
-   [Programming](https://brick.do/M97QENmBmO0L)Â and
    [Programming
    Languages](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/languages-programming-pR2EBPYNNqDm)
    -   [AutoHotkey](https://brick.do/b097PBa2bpv3)
    -   [Clojure](https://brick.do/ZdgvzPy8j5n2)
    -   [Haskell](https://brick.do/38gwm7Px64YD)

-   [Philosophy](https://brick.do/qMG580oDDmzN)
-   [Surviving Seminary](https://brick.do/rLPB6Y7PpoWP)

Here's some [hobbies](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/my-hobbies-0KlkYKaQLxgv) and some [media](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/media-2lgppnPwkXZ2) that I enjoy.

### Brewing Ideas

- [ ] Why I loveÂ [AutoHotkey](https://brick.do/b097PBa2bpv3)Â so much,Â and how I use it together withÂ [Roam Research](https://brick.do/MbVK3Lx1EvpV)Â andÂ [VS Code](https://brick.do/bjlZgglMDmR1)Â for myÂ [Personal Knowledge Management](https://brick.do/oR8yQ5DZwPOo)Â workflow
- [ ] What's so troublesome aboutÂ [Platonism](https://brick.do/gnaREAgxlXKA)Â as a Christian [Metaphysic](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/metaphysics-9JzEDp119oL3) and why I prefer (and thinkÂ [The Bible](https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o)Â is more consistent with) something more like Hebraic Covenantalism
- [ ] Why EVERYONE should learn basicÂ [Category Theory](https://brick.do/vV4KxM2bqG20)Â  and therefore why we should teach it in schoolsÂ 
- [ ] Why anyone who aspires to clear thinking, reasoning, and communicating should learnÂ [Haskell](https://brick.do/38gwm7Px64YD)Â (especially ChristianÂ [Theologians](https://brick.do/xY8jvmMRy7NY)Â and students of theÂ [Divinities](https://brick.do/qrA09grvWyYa))
- [ ] Listening carefully toÂ [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://brick.do/NdxpwXjBRn3A)Â on a variety of topics:
    - Being, Doing, Becoming
    - [Compassion](https://brick.do/pPR0JK3zBj51)Â andÂ [Compersion](https://brick.do/gQDv7BW0d9pE)Â vsÂ [Sadism](https://brick.do/xV9oWo7bdeEk)Â andÂ [Envy](https://brick.do/JEGoYJwGYwXQ) -   on">Better metrics for     assessing the state of society
    - First-, Second-, and Third-Person Epistemics
    - TheÂ [Hegelian Dialectic](https://brick.do/PwE2aOp7A6zG)Â and Seeking Synthesis through Rigorous Empathy
- [ ] The concept ofÂ [The Liberal Arts](https://brick.do/Eqw8drgZ78vo)Â as those skills which members of a free society need to be successful (and which a free society needs its members to have to be successful itself)
- [ ] Why the termÂ [Position](https://brick.do/BJBY7weBo4g6)Â is useful for expressing the [generic concept](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/abstraction-kxx9rO6Jl4x4) of one's intellectual assent and convicted commitment to supporting an idea, belief, or decision
- [ ] Why "[Character](https://brick.do/oWkjWd63E7dE)" is a more useful and less error-prone concept than "[Essence](https://brick.do/48VvMR7a7QXQ)" when it comes to seeking and communicating our grasp of the behavior, quality, or "is-ness" of a thing
- [ ] How Symbols andÂ [Typology](https://brick.do/bAbWRQZj1mgO)Â serve as proving grounds for our understanding ofÂ [Truth](https://brick.do/5kaA4PWWJwnR)Â andÂ [Meaning](https://brick.do/XOR2pwdpQoKW)Â (and howÂ [Category Theory](https://brick.do/vV4KxM2bqG20)Â clarifies the whole project)
- [ ] Learning [Clojure](https://brick.do/ZdgvzPy8j5n2), and some thoughts that has provoked about language andÂ [Learning](https://brick.do/Jw6Jd8KVLq78)Â in general

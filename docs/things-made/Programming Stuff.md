# Programming Stuff

I like to tinker
with [[AutoHotkey]], [[Clojure]],
and [[Haskell]].
Here's
some [[GitHub]] pages
with some things I've worked on.

### [[AutoHotkey]]

#### [roam-autohotkey](https://github.com/CFiggers/roam-autohotkey)

This repo contains a small collection of
useful [[AutoHotkey]] 
scripts for interacting
with [[Roam Research]].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [[Haskell]]

#### [quad-ci](https://github.com/CFiggers/quad-ci)

This repo contains a reimplementation of the "Quad CI" demo project
outlined in [The Simple Haskell
Handbook](https://leanpub.com/simple-haskell-book). It uses docker and
integrates
with [[GitHub]] to
run a simple Continuous Integration server. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [[Clojure]]

#### [cuad-ci](https://github.com/CFiggers/cuad-ci)

This repo contains a re-reimplementation of the "Quad CI" demo project
outlined in [The Simple Haskell
Handbook](https://leanpub.com/simple-haskell-book), but translated (by
me)
from [[Haskell]] into [[Clojure]].

#### [cli4clj](https://github.com/ruedigergad/cli4clj)

**cli4clj** is a library for implementing interactive Command Line
Interfaces
in [[Clojure]].
I contributed a small feature addition to this project.

#### [coffee-shop](https://github.com/CFiggers/coffee-shop)

**coffee-shop** is a simple toy project to help me and my younger
brother
practice [[Clojure]].
Some day, if we keep working on it, it will be a fully-featured business
simulation game where you run a coffee shop.

#### [ninja-village](https://github.com/CFiggers/ninja-village)

**ninja-village** is a simple toy project to help me and my younger
brother practice Clojure. Some day, if we keep working on it, it will be
a fully-featured turn-based strategy game where you run a village of
ninjas and fight other villages for dominance.

#### [passman](https://github.com/CFiggers/babashka-passman)

**passman** is a simple command-line utility for storing and generating
passwords. It is based on [this tutorial by Daniel Amber (a.k.a. On the
Code Again)](https://youtu.be/jm0RXmyjRJ8) and implemented using
[Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka),
[sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (via [this Babashka
pod](https://github.com/babashka/pod-babashka-go-sqlite3)), and
[stash](https://github.com/rorokimdim/stash) (also via Babashka pod)..

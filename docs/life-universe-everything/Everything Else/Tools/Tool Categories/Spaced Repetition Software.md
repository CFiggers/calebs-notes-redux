# Spaced Repetition Software

### **What is Spaced Repetition Software?**

**Spaced Repetition Software** includes any computer program designed to
assist with
the [[Spaced Repetition]] method
of learning and memorization. Using **Spaced Repetition Software** is an
instance of the broader methodology that Andy Matsuchak calls
"[[Programmable Attention]]."

I use **Spaced Repetition Software** for
memorizing [[Hebrew]] and [[Greek]] vocabulary
words and grammar flashcards.

Examples of **Spaced Repetition Software** include:

-   [[Anki]]
-   Cerego
-   NeuraCache
-   RemNote
-   Quizlet

Some applications and programs are not solely focused
on [[Spaced Repetition]],
but have features or optional add-ins that support using that
method. [[Roam Research]] is
an example of this (having both rudimentary native features and expanded
options with
the [[Unofficial Roam Toolkit]] browser
extension.)

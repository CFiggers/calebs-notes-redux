# Axiology

### **What is Axiology?**

The word "**Axiology**" comes
from [[Greek]]:

-   ἄξιος ("axios") = "worthy"
-   λόγος ("logos") = "word"

So "**Axio**" + "**logy**" literally means "Words about what is Worthy."
Another way to phrase it is, "The Study
of [[The Good]]."

Broadly, **Axiology** has two major branches:

-   [[Ethics]] -
    The study of human behavior (i.e. Right and Wrong)
-   [[Aesthetics]] -
    The study of beauty in nature and art (i.e. Desirable and
    Undesirable)

# Philosophy

## **What is Philosophy?**

**Philosophy** is the principled investigation of what can be perceived
and understood about [[The Universe]],
including what can be perceived and understood about **Philosophy**
itself.

The word "**Philosophy**" comes from
[[Greek]]:

-   φίλος ("philos") = "Love"
-   σοφία ("sophia") = "Wisdom"

So "**Philo**" + "**sophy**" literally means "Love
of [[Wisdom]]."
I think of **Philosophy** as a sub-category
of [[Practical Theology]] (but
not everyone would agree with that).

It can be helpful (if not always perfectly accurate) to think of
**Philosophy** as a tree with branches. Different people group the
branches of **Philosophy** together differently (and that's ok—see the
section at the bottom of this page). I like to think of **Philosophy**
as having the following six branches:

Input:

-   [[Metaphilosophy]] -
    The study of **Philosophy** itself (this list is an example of
    Metaphilosophy!)

The Core:

-   [[Metaphysics]] -
    The study of "reality"
-   [[Epistemology]] -
    The study of "knowing"
-   [[Axiology]] -
    The study of "goodness"
-   [[Logic]] -
    The study of "reasoning"

Output:

-   [[Applied Philosophy]] -
    The study of using **Philosophy** in real life and in other fields
    of study

These branches interrelate. One way to visualize these relations at a
high level might be as follows:

Each of the major branches naturally informs and influences each of the
others. But some lines of influence (like that
of [[Metaphilosophy]] on [[Epistemology]],
etc.) are clearer—hence the darker lines.

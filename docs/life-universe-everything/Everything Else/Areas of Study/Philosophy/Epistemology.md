# Epistemology

### **What is Epistemology?**

The word "**Philosophy**" comes
from [[Greek]]:

-   ἐπιστήμη ("episteme") = "knowledge"
-   λόγος ("logos") = "word"

So "**Epistem**" + "**ology**" literally means "Words
about [[Knowledge]]."
**Epistemology** encompasses
what [[Knowledge]] is,
whether and how humans can interact
with [[Knowledge]],
and [systems of organizing
knowledge](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/knowledge-management-9lXGVWOAJEMj)
so that humans can make use of it.

**Epistemology** relates
to [[Metaphysics]] because [[Reality]] (i.e.
what truly exists) and what/how one knows about that reality are closely
related questions.

**Epistemology** relates
to [[Logic]] because [[Knowledge]] plays
an essential role
in [[Reason]].

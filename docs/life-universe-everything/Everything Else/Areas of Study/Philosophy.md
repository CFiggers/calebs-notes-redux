# Philosophy

### **What is Philosophy?**

**Philosophy** is the principled investigation of what can be perceived
and understood about [The
Universe](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-universe-wMV8qe9GVV7j),
including what can be perceived and understood about **Philosophy**
itself.

The word "**Philosophy**" comes from
[Greek](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/greek-B245jwkbZLRq):

-   φίλος ("philos") = "Love"
-   σοφία ("sophia") = "Wisdom"

So "**Philo**" + "**sophy**" literally means "Love
of <a href="https://brick.do/g3Wql6KMGv5n" class="page-link">Wisdom</a>."
I think of **Philosophy** as a sub-category
of <a href="https://brick.do/aKa7YokLW8Np" class="page-link">Practical Theology</a> (but
not everyone would agree with that).

It can be helpful (if not always perfectly accurate) to think of
**Philosophy** as a tree with branches. Different people group the
branches of **Philosophy** together differently (and that's ok—see the
section at the bottom of this page). I like to think of **Philosophy**
as having the following six branches:

Input:

-   <a href="https://brick.do/n010qNGP12jQ" class="page-link">Metaphilosophy</a> -
    The study of **Philosophy** itself (this list is an example of
    Metaphilosophy!)

The Core:

-   <a href="https://brick.do/9JzEDp119oL3" class="page-link">Metaphysics</a> -
    The study of "reality"
-   <a href="https://brick.do/BKbM4zbX7MaK" class="page-link">Epistemology</a> -
    The study of "knowing"
-   <a href="https://brick.do/MlZadMl7nwZQ" class="page-link">Axiology</a> -
    The study of "goodness"
-   <a href="https://brick.do/W2EjxX1xaMXz" class="page-link">Logic</a> -
    The study of "reasoning"

Output:

-   <a href="https://brick.do/N6vyk1V0rbVG" class="page-link">Applied Philosophy</a> -
    The study of using **Philosophy** in real life and in other fields
    of study

These branches interrelate. One way to visualize these relations at a
high level might be as follows:

Each of the major branches naturally informs and influences each of the
others. But some lines of influence (like that
of <a href="https://brick.do/n010qNGP12jQ" class="page-link">Metaphilosophy</a> on <a href="https://brick.do/BKbM4zbX7MaK" class="page-link">Epistemology</a>,
etc.) are clearer—hence the darker lines.

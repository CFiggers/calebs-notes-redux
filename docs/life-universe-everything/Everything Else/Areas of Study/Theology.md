# Theology

### **What is Theology?**

**Theology** is the spiritual and academic study of
[God](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/god-pDKA557JXbPo) and what he
communicates to humanity (this is called
[Revelation](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/revelation-Q36lrVAO0Da8)).

The word "**Theology"** comes from
[Greek](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/greek-B245jwkbZLRq):

-   Θεός ("theos") = "God"
-   λόγος ("logos") = "word"

So "**Theo**" + "**logy**" literally means "Words of God." This way of
phrasing it contains an intentional double meaning: "Words *of* God" can
mean "words about God," as in what we have to say and understand *about
God.* It can also mean "words *from* God," as in what God has to say and
what we can therefore understand *about everything else.*

I think of **Theology** as the starting place where all other
understanding begins (but not everyone would agree with that).

It can be helpful (if not always perfectly accurate) to think of
**Theology** as a tree with branches. Different people group the
branches of **Theology** differently (and that's ok—see the section at
the bottom of this page). I like to think of **Theology** as having the
following branches:

Of God:

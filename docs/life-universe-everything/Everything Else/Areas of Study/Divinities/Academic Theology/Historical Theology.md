# Historical Theology

### **What is Historical Theology?**

**Historical Theology** is a sub-branch
of <a href="https://brick.do/OB3XnEMAk3VV" class="page-link">Academic Theology</a> that
focuses on
how <a href="https://brick.do/D8pwD0yja685" class="page-link">Theology</a> as
a whole has changed and developed
throughout <a href="https://brick.do/yGJqlQD08KX6" class="page-link">Church History</a>.

**Historical Theology** has the same relationship
to <a href="https://brick.do/D8pwD0yja685" class="page-link">Theology</a> that <a href="https://brick.do/eRw5dEX5L5Oq" class="page-link">History of Ideas</a> has
to <a href="https://brick.do/qMG580oDDmzN" class="page-link">Philosophy</a>.

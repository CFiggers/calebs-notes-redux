# Historical Theology

### **What is Historical Theology?**

**Historical Theology** is a sub-branch
of [[Academic Theology]] that
focuses on
how [[Theology]] as
a whole has changed and developed
throughout [[Church History]].

**Historical Theology** has the same relationship
to [[Theology]] that [[History of Ideas]] has
to [[Philosophy]].

# Theology

### **What is Theology?**

**Theology** is the spiritual and academic study of
[[God]] and what he
communicates to humanity (this is called
[[Revelation]]).

The word "**Theology"** comes from
[[Greek]]:

-   Θεός ("theos") = "God"
-   λόγος ("logos") = "word"

So "**Theo**" + "**logy**" literally means "Words of God." This way of
phrasing it contains an intentional double meaning: "Words *of* God" can
mean "words about God," as in what we have to say and understand *about
God.* It can also mean "words *from* God," as in what God has to say and
what we can therefore understand *about everything else.*

I think of **Theology** as the starting place where all other
understanding begins (but not everyone would agree with that).

It can be helpful (if not always perfectly accurate) to think of
**Theology** as a tree with branches. Different people group the
branches of **Theology** differently (and that's ok—see the section at
the bottom of this page). I like to think of **Theology** as having the
following branches:

Of God:

-   [[Theology Proper]] -
    The study
    of [[God]] himself
    and
    of [[God The Father]]
-   [[Christology]] -
    The study
    of [[Jesus Christ]],
    who
    is [[God The Son]]
-   [[Pneumatology]] -
    The study
    of [[God The Holy Spirit]]

Of God's other
[[Revelation]]:

-   [[Ktisiology]] -
    The study of what God reveals
    about [[Creation]]
-   [[Hamartiology]] -
    The study of what God reveals
    about [[Sin]]
-   [[Soteriology]] -
    The study of what God reveals about his plan
    for [[Salvation]]
-   [[Ecclesiology]] -
    The study of what God reveals about his Church
-   [[Eschatology]] -
    The study of what God reveals about the way the story ends

Of Application:

-   [[Practical Theology]] -
    The study of using **Theology** in real life and in other fields of
    study
    (like [[Philosophy]])
-   [[Divinities]] -
    The rigorous, academic study
    of [[The Bible]] and
    **Theology**

# Category Theory

### **What is Category Theory?**

**Category Theory** is an *extremely* abstract branch
of [[Mathematics]].

Most branches of
[[Mathematics|math]] (like
Arithmetic, Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, etc.) use symbols (like
numbers) to represent things. They then use those representations to
calculate stuff, prove or disprove hypotheses, or make predictions.

**Category Theory** is a bit different from most math. Where many
branches of math take particular mathematical structures as their focus
of study, **Category Theory** is about *symbolic structure itself.*
**Category Theory** is about rigorously examining the relationships
between things. It is about how small stuff combines together into
bigger stuff (the technical term for this
is [[Composition]]).
It is about generalizing patterns in those relationships
and [[Composition]]s
so that they can be recognized and reapplied elsewhere. 

I have found in **Category Theory** a useful set of conceptual
frameworks and rigorous methodologies for thinking
about [[Areas of Study]] full
of highly abstract and hard-to-falsify propositions
(like [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]]).

### Category Theory [[Concepts]]

**Category Theory** has some
important [[Concepts]] associated
with it:

-   [[Abstraction]]
-   [[Composition]] and [[Decomposition]]
-   [[Identity]]

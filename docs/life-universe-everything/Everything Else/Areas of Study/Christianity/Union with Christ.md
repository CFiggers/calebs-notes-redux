# Union with Christ

### What is **Union with Christ?**

 

Just
like <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> himself
is three persons, yet
one <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>,
and just like a husband and wife are two people but one covenant union,
the Holy Spirit unites believing sinners to Jesus by a new kind of
covenant in his blood so that they, while still being separate people,
are considered one with Jesus. 

This special covenant explains how our sins can be paid for by his
suffering. It also explains how his righteous satisfaction of all God's
commands applies to us as though we had done it ourselves. It also
explains how we can live with God forever and never die—by this special
union, Jesus's resurrection becomes our resurrection, and his eternal,
indestructible life becomes ours too.

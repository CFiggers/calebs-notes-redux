# The Gospel

### What is the gospel?

**The gospel** is the good news that
[Christians](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/christianity-k8g6Bg2loJQo)
believe
about <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>,
Humans, <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>,
and <a href="https://brick.do/0mP8w8mKDKZy" class="page-link">Salvation</a>—all
thanks
to <a href="https://brick.do/eLn0ya3z9rXy" class="page-link">Jesus Christ</a>. 

This good news is found
in <a href="https://brick.do/L5D2L2nMpe8o" class="page-link">The Bible</a>,
which is the Judeo-Christian book of Holy Scripture.

#### 1) <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>

Before the beginning
of <a href="https://brick.do/79PbDAJXw0yr" class="page-link">Everything Else</a>,
from all
eternity <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> has
existed timeless, perfect, and *very, very happy.* While any other
single being would have found it [very
lonely](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/loneliness-ZBw60rqQKmB8) to be all
by themselves for so
long, <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> is
special. He is and has always been [three
persons](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-trinity-gBk0KVe3wBL7) who
together are
fully <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>—<a href="https://brick.do/3QYyVl093xzw" class="page-link">God The Father</a>, <a href="https://brick.do/22JRbEvL02mM" class="page-link">God The Son</a>,
and <a href="https://brick.do/o4MxaNb7JmEm" class="page-link">God The Holy Spirit</a>.
These three persons who
are <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> have
always known and loved one another perfectly and infinitely.
Their <a href="https://brick.do/5bPAKq1kW42O" class="page-link">Joy</a> together
is [exquisitely
perfect](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/holiness-0lqBQ64proVx) and
[amazingly good](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/glory-ejOgv8nD4NNK).

Although he was [under no
obligation](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/god-s-freedom-Xe1ml4r5KDm4) to
do
so, <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> freely
[decided](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/god-s-will-JgDDlDEqWbKl) to
[create](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/creation-P6Denm5RQdzn) a
[universe](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-universe-wMV8qe9GVV7j) and
to populate that universe with
[intelligent](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/intelligence-gJ3DVJqemx6G),
[self-aware](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/consciousness-pne6NqQbgvkl),
[moral](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/morality-QeVD2dlZ8nRN) beings
capable of knowing him and loving him too—and therefore capable of
sharing his
infinite <a href="https://brick.do/1Ym3NO8WkLYG" class="page-link">Happiness</a>.
He did this to demonstrate what kind
of <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> he
is. Sharing all his goodness with creatures like us does just that.

**Section Summary:** God—Father, Son, and Spirit—created a good universe
to show off and share his glory.

#### 2) Humans 

<a href="https://brick.do/RlZaMEjoV9kY" class="page-link">Time</a> and <a href="https://brick.do/7B2w67l7klMv" class="page-link">Reality</a> as
we know them began
when <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> created <a href="https://brick.do/wMV8qe9GVV7j" class="page-link">The Universe</a>.
He made it perfectly, and called everything in it
"[Good](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-good-6nDYE3kQmB25)"—because,
thanks to him, it was.

The crown jewel of this new universe
that <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> had
made was a curious union that resembled himself. The Bible says that God
made them "In the image of God." Adam and Eve, the first man and first
woman, were married—making them *both* individual persons *and* a
relationship of unity that made them, for some purposes, like they were
a single being. 

<a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> put
Adam and Eve in a garden paradise that he had made for them to live in
and take care of, and blessed them to be fruitful and multiply. They
were the garden's keepers and guardians. They enjoyed their work and
their relationships with one another and
with <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>,
their maker, who loved them very, very much.

<a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> also
gave Adam a very important command that he was to share with his wife,
Eve, and all the new humans who would be their children after
them. <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> had
put a special tree in the garden—a tree of the knowledge of good and
evil—and <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> commanded
them not to eat its fruit.

If they did, God told them, they would die.

**Section Summary:** God made human beings to glorify himself in their
supremely enjoying him forever.

#### 3) <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>

<a href="https://brick.do/9aQQgGbYrBAW" class="page-link">The Serpent</a> was
the craftiest of the
creatures <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> had
made, and he deceived Eve about
what <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> had
commanded and why. Adam should have stopped this, but he didn't. Adam
and Eve broke the command God had given them and they ate from the tree
God told them not to eat of. This was the very
first <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>,
and it broke the happy relationship Adam and Eve had with each other and
the one they shared with their creator.

Just
like <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> said,
Adam and Eve died that day. But they didn't die physically. They died
spiritually—which means, they were cut off from the source of spiritual
life, which
is <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> himself.

Humans have been spiritually dead, broken, and cut off from truly
enjoying <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>—and
each other—ever since.

But <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> loves
this universe that he made, and particularly he loves the people he put
in it. So
while <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> certainly
cannot go
unpunished, <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> was
merciful to Adam and Eve—a surprise, given what they had done! He
promised Adam and Eve that one day one of Eve's children would make
everything right again. This was the first echo of what would one day be
known as the gospel
of <a href="https://brick.do/eLn0ya3z9rXy" class="page-link">Jesus Christ</a>.

Humanity waited a very long time for the child that God promised to
come. Adam and Eve had many children together, and after them their
children had children. But no matter how promising they all seemed at
first, none of them was the
one <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> had
meant in his promise.

<a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> was
keeping his promise, though, even when it didn't look like
much. <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> befriended
several sinful, imperfect people—a surprise, given
their <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>!—and
made more and clearer promises to
them. <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> chose
a people and gave them his Law, though they couldn't keep it, to show
how serious
humanity's <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> problem
is. This proved that because we're all infected
with <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>,
none of us can rescue ourselves from our terminal spiritual illnesses.

**Section Summary:** Humans sinned and death entered creation when we
traded enjoyment of God for lesser enjoyments.

#### 4) <a href="https://brick.do/0mP8w8mKDKZy" class="page-link">Salvation</a>

Then
came <a href="https://brick.do/eLn0ya3z9rXy" class="page-link">Jesus Christ</a>. 

Jesus was the son of a human woman, but his father
was <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> himself.
Jesus lived sinlessly for 30 years, keeping every single requirement of
the Law perfectly. Then, he revealed himself to the religious leaders
of <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>'s
people as both the promised Messiah and
as <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>'s
own son.

The leaders didn't believe Jesus and saw him as a threat to their
political and religious influence. So they betrayed him to the Romans
and threatened the Roman governor to convince him to murder Jesus for
them.

Jesus could have stopped this at any time, but he didn't. This was part
of the plan that the persons of the Godhead had made together before
they created the world. They knew that humanity
would <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>,
and they planned
that <a href="https://brick.do/22JRbEvL02mM" class="page-link">God The Son</a> would
become a human to
[redeem](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/redemption-72prLaxWjLOw) them by
[dying in their
place.](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/atonement-5P6zZG3WJkK8)

When Jesus was [crucified by the
Romans](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/the-crucifixion-KXlVk44ggWwd),
something else was also
happening. <a href="https://brick.do/3QYyVl093xzw" class="page-link">God The Father</a> punished <a href="https://brick.do/22JRbEvL02mM" class="page-link">God The Son</a> for
humanity's sin. This explains how God had been merciful to sinners all
throughout history. Instead of punishing them for what they had
done, <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> held
back their punishment, knowing that one day he would take it on himself.

Jesus died on that Roman cross—the only person to ever die who truly
didn't deserve it. They buried him in a tomb, and his followers
despaired. But
then <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> did
a <a href="https://brick.do/o5zXnoYlGkOx" class="page-link">Miracle</a>—one
as powerful
as <a href="https://brick.do/P6Denm5RQdzn" class="page-link">Creation</a> itself
had
been. <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> [raised Jesus
from the dead](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/resurrection-wJanx0bEMgVM)
and gave him a glorified body and an indestructible life!

After showing himself to his disciples and teaching them for a few
weeks, Jesus ascended
into <a href="https://brick.do/gZ618XlK2xd5" class="page-link">Heaven</a> and
became the enthroned king
of <a href="https://brick.do/wMV8qe9GVV7j" class="page-link">The Universe</a>.
From there, he sent [the Holy
Spirit](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/god-the-holy-spirit-o4MxaNb7JmEm)—who
had been eagerly waiting to go—to live with and help his followers until
Jesus comes back.

**Section Summary:** Despite our sin, God so loved the world that he
sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to live among us, die for our sin, and rise
again from the dead so that we could be brought back to God. 

#### 5) So What?

Now, thanks to Jesus, there is a way to be reunited
with <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>,
the way Adam and Eve were before they fell. This way does not hang on
[merely
human](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/creaturely-limitation-GgmMNAMdbKww)
effort or obedience—the Law proved that even if humans know exactly what
to do, we will fail to do it as long as our hearts are full
of <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>. 

Instead, the only thing we must do to be saved and reunited
with <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> is
[believe in Jesus](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/faith-WbMLZvjBjx4E) and
trust that [his
sacrifice](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/atonement-5P6zZG3WJkK8) covers
[our treason](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/sin-46dMY0LDO1aZ)
against <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>.

<a href="https://brick.do/o4MxaNb7JmEm" class="page-link">God The Holy Spirit</a> makes
this possible. He spiritually [touches human hearts and makes them live
again](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/regeneration-JQvJx4YlQNRg). This
spiritual life results in us [realizing how wicked we
are](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/conviction-80p62DmDV4bX) and [wanting
to change](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/repentance-zPeOjaXlG5x3). That
heart change leads us to realize how much we need to be back in good
relationship
with <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>,
or else life is
without <a href="https://brick.do/XOR2pwdpQoKW" class="page-link">Meaning</a>.
And it causes us to
have <a href="https://brick.do/WbMLZvjBjx4E" class="page-link">Faith</a> in
Jesus, which the Holy Spirit uses to do
[some](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/union-with-christ-mOKYkZ4xvn81)
[very](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/justification-D7gLZQag0Kne)
[special](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/progressive-sanctification-nDKJJq3JL8vO)
[things](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/spiritual-gifts-d3EdgPwZEye3).

Not everyone will believe in Jesus and be saved from
their <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>,
because <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> makes
us blind and delirious enough to think
that <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> is
better
than <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>.
This
offends <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> deeply,
because it is exactly the opposite of what is
true. <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a>,
being righteous, will not ignore
mankind's <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a>.
He will either absorb
your <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> into
Jesus's [payment](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/atonement-5P6zZG3WJkK8),
if you [believe in him](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/faith-WbMLZvjBjx4E)
and [ask him to rescue
you](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/prayer-Lwg0k04qJG23), or else the
[punishment](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/justice-3aAarApjVel7) for
your <a href="https://brick.do/46dMY0LDO1aZ" class="page-link">Sin</a> stays
on you and [you will suffer it yourself after you
die](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/hell-rJok9eyQGLn6). This means that
the stakes are very high. **So turn away from your sin and believe in
Jesus!** It is the only way to be [rescued from what you
deserve](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/redemption-72prLaxWjLOw) and to
instead
have <a href="https://brick.do/mDlGVO2Q7qyp" class="page-link">Eternal Life</a> and <a href="https://brick.do/1Ym3NO8WkLYG" class="page-link">Happiness</a> with <a href="https://brick.do/pDKA557JXbPo" class="page-link">God</a> forever.

**Section Summary:** Jesus made a way for all people who trust him to be
saved from sin and death. Believe in him and have eternal life!

#### Summary of The Gospel

So the gospel is this good news: although humans sinned and ruined their
joy-filled relationships with God and with one another, God sent Jesus
to make a way for sinners to come back to life and happiness in God by
believing in Jesus to take away their sin.

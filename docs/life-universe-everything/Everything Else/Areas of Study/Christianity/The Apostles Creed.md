(**The Apostle's Creed** was originally recorded in both [[Greek]] and [[Latin]], not [[English]].

It sometimes goes by the name "Symbol of the Apostles" or "Symbol of [[The Trinity]]," with the word "Symbol" being used almost interchangeably with the more current term "Creed." 

This English translation and the introductory statement before it is from the *Trinity Hymnal*, rev. ed (Suwanee, GA: Great Commission Publications, Inc., 1990), 845.)

(**The Apostle's Creed** was originally recorded in
both [[Greek]] and [[Latin]],
not [[English]].
It sometimes goes by the name "Symbol of the Apostles" or "Symbol
of [[The Trinity]],"
with the word "Symbol" being used almost interchangeably with the more
current term "Creed." This English translation and the introductory
statement before it is from the *Trinity Hymnal*, rev. ed (Suwanee, GA:
Great Commission Publications, Inc., 1990), 845.)

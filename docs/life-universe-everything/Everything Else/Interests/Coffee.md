### **What is Coffee?**

You know what coffee is (probably). ðŸ˜‰

I enjoy several things about **Coffee**. First, I like the taste.
Second, I enjoy the process of making **Coffee** at home. It is a
skill-based challenge with immediate, objective feedback on whether you
did a good job. Third (and it's a distant third), it's nice to have a
caffeine boost from time to time.

# Human Enterprise

## **What is Human Enterprise?**

The words "**Human**" and "**Enterprise**" both come from [[Latin]] (through [[French]]):

-   *humanus* = "Of or relating to mankind"
-   *inter* + *prehendō* = "What is undertaken"

"**Human Enterprise**" is therefore an extremely broad umbrella term (and intentionally so) comprising all of the various things that mankind attempts to do.

Some (but by no means all!) of the sub-categories that I will treat under **Human Enterprise** (as opposed to [[Academic Disciplines]] and [[The Sciences]]) are:

-   [[Aeronautics]]
-   [[Business]]
-   [[Education]]
-   [[Engineering]]
-   [[Finance]]
-   [[Government]]
-   [[Industry]]
-   [[Journalism]]
-   [[Medicine]]
-   [[Warfare]]

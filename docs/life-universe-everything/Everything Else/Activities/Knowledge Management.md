# Knowledge Management

### **What is Knowledge Management?**

**Knowledge Management** is the
[Activity](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/activities-L0MGOrw3YAZK) of
collecting, organizing, and
storing <a href="https://brick.do/1yYm68Z5pWrO" class="page-link">Information</a>,
in order to promote the
[Usefulness](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/utility-BR2b1mlyX49O) of
that <a href="https://brick.do/1yYm68Z5pWrO" class="page-link">Information</a>.
**Knowledge Management** is a type
of <a href="https://brick.do/JLr2wNxDeyqQ" class="page-link">Knowledge Work</a>.

In practice, it's difficult (maybe impossible?) to do **Knowledge
Management** without
doing <a href="https://brick.do/1nxy2nBAgwmk" class="page-link">Content Management</a> somewhere
along the way.

**Knowledge Management** is itself a broad category with many
sub-domains. Here are just a few:

-   <a href="https://brick.do/4kRNp4DgyR7B" class="page-link">Organizational Knowledge Management</a>
-   <a href="https://brick.do/oR8yQ5DZwPOo" class="page-link">Personal Knowledge Management</a>

Some other areas of study and practice can be modeled as sub-domains of
**Knowledge Management**. Here are a few of those:

-   <a href="https://brick.do/Ll8la4oobZG7" class="page-link">Task Management</a>
-   <a href="https://brick.do/12ra33Jp7o9r" class="page-link">Project Management</a>

**Knowledge Management** principles are broadly applicable to a wide
range
of <a href="https://brick.do/qkQXjGQW5ArX" class="page-link">Human Enterprise</a>,
because just about everything
that <a href="https://brick.do/nKmmpg4Gmkm3" class="page-link">People</a> get
up to has informational components involved.

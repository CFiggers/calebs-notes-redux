# Knowledge Management

## What is Knowledge Management?

**Knowledge Management** is the [[Activities|Activity]] of collecting, organizing, and storing [[Information]], in order to promote the [[Utility|Usefulness]] of that [[Information]]. **Knowledge Management** is a type of [[Knowledge Work]].

In practice, it's difficult (maybe impossible?) to do **Knowledge Management** without doing [[Content Management]] somewhere along the way.

**Knowledge Management** is itself a broad category with many sub-domains. Here are just a few:

-   [[Organizational Knowledge Management]]
-   [[Personal Knowledge Management]]

Some other areas of study and practice can be modeled as sub-domains of **Knowledge Management**. Here are a few of those:

-   [[Task Management]]
-   [[Project Management]]

**Knowledge Management** principles are broadly applicable to a wide range of [[Human Enterprise]], because just about everything that [[People]] get up to has informational components involved.

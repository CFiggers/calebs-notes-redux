# Knowledge Management

### **What is Knowledge Management?**

**Knowledge Management** is the
[Activity](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/activities-L0MGOrw3YAZK) of
collecting, organizing, and
storing [[Information]],
in order to promote the
[Usefulness](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/utility-BR2b1mlyX49O) of
that [[Information]].
**Knowledge Management** is a type
of [[Knowledge Work]].

In practice, it's difficult (maybe impossible?) to do **Knowledge
Management** without
doing [[Content Management]] somewhere
along the way.

**Knowledge Management** is itself a broad category with many
sub-domains. Here are just a few:

-   [[Organizational Knowledge Management]]
-   [[Personal Knowledge Management]]

Some other areas of study and practice can be modeled as sub-domains of
**Knowledge Management**. Here are a few of those:

-   [[Task Management]]
-   [[Project Management]]

**Knowledge Management** principles are broadly applicable to a wide
range
of [[Human Enterprise]],
because just about everything
that [[People]] get
up to has informational components involved.

### [[Tools]] for Doing Knowledge Management

# Programming

## What is Programming?

**Programming** is the [[Activities|Activity]] of writing structured instruction sets for computers to follow, in order to accomplish some calculation or task. **Programming** is a type of [[Knowledge Work]].

I am not a professional programmer. But I do it for fun, and I think it is a good way to learn how to think carefully about how ideas interact with each other.

I have *some* experience with these [[Languages (Programming)|Programming Languages]] (some more than others, and none too terribly much):

-   [[AutoHotkey]]
-   [[Clojure]]
-   [[Haskell]]
-   [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[JavaScript]]
-   [[Janet]]
-   [[JavaScript]]
    -   [[TypeScript]]
-   [[Python]]
    -   [[Hy]]
-   Salesforce Languages
    -   [[Apex]]
    -   [[Visualforce]]
-   [[SQL]] (and derivatives, like SOQL)

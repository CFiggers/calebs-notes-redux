# Programming

### **What is Programming?**

**Programming** is the
[Activity](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/activities-L0MGOrw3YAZK) of
writing structured instruction sets for computers to follow, in order to
accomplish some calculation or task. **Programming** is a type
of [[Knowledge Work]].

I am not a professional programmer. But I do it for fun, and I think it
is a good way to learn how to think carefully about how ideas interact
with each other.

I have *some* experience with these [Programming
Languages](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/languages-programming-pR2EBPYNNqDm)
(some more than others, and none too terribly much):

-   [[AutoHotkey]]
-   [[Clojure]]
-   [[Haskell]]
-   [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[JavaScript]]
-   [[Python]]
-   Salesforce Languages
    -   [[Apex]]
    -   [[Visualforce]]
-   [[SQL]] (and
    derivatives, like SOQL)

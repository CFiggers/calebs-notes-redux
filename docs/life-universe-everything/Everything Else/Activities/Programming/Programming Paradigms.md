# Programming Paradigms

### What are **Programming Paradigms?**

A **Programming Paradigm** is a (somewhat-arbitrary) classification that
programmers use to
[Label](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/labels-yxeGm0QEvdaz) major
differences of approach when [solving
problems](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/problem-solving-1bjbLbOZ4gRE)
in <a href="https://brick.do/M97QENmBmO0L" class="page-link">Programming</a>.

Most (if not all) major [Programming
Languages](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/languages-programming-pR2EBPYNNqDm)
in use today combine elements from multiple different **Programming
Paradigms** in their design and implementation. 

Since a **Programming Paradim** is essentially just a loose description
of the approach that a programmer chooses when solving problems, it is
often possible to solve the same problem using multiple paradims even
within the same language. 

That said, most languages give extra attention to facilitating a
particular paradigmatic approach more strongly than others. This leads
certain languages (or individual language features) to become associated
with certain paradigms. As an
example, <a href="https://brick.do/38gwm7Px64YD" class="page-link">Haskell</a> is
strongly associated with
the <a href="https://brick.do/1G6WVkM5m8yM" class="page-link">Functional Programming Paradigm</a>.

At the end of the day, a **Programming Paradigm** is a style
of <a href="https://brick.do/X90XApqY3ow2" class="page-link">Thinking</a> that
applies
to <a href="https://brick.do/M97QENmBmO0L" class="page-link">Programming</a> tasks
(and sometimes other tasks too).

The most common **Programming Paradigms** in use today are:

-   <a href="https://brick.do/y5QpmJj0k4Eb" class="page-link">Imperative Programming Paradigm</a>
-   <a href="https://brick.do/4n424OXZB5dq" class="page-link">Procedural Programming Paradigm</a>
-   <a href="https://brick.do/1YpLMNv4j3qY" class="page-link">Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm</a>
-   <a href="https://brick.do/1G6WVkM5m8yM" class="page-link">Functional Programming Paradigm</a>
-   <a href="https://brick.do/7KgZxN3kjxqD" class="page-link">Literate Programming Paradigm</a>

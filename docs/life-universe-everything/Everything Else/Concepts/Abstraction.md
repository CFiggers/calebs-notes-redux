# Abstraction

### **What is Abstraction?**

**Abstraction** is a form of [[Pattern Recognition]].
Rather than an exact match between two things, an **Abstraction** is a
pattern in which only some of the details of each thing match—the
dissimilarities are ignored. 

A good (or *useful*) **Abstraction** preserves shared qualities or
details that are meaningful. A poor (or *unhelpful*) **Abstraction**
creates links between unimportant shared details.

**Abstraction** and
[[Reification]] are
inverse counterparts.

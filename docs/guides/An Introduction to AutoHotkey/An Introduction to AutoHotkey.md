# An Introduction to AutoHotkey

For an answer to the question, "What is AutoHotkey?" see [[AutoHotkey]].

## Why Learn [[AutoHotkey]]?

Well, if your daily driver laptop or desktop computer is a Mac or runs some variant of [[Linux]], this is really easy to answer—**you shouldn't!** [[AutoHotkey]] is a [[Windows|Microsoft Windows]]-only program.

But if your primary computer is a [[Windows]] machine, you should learn AutoHotkey because it will save you time by letting you automate keystrokes and mouse clicks. Depending on [[Workflow|what you most frequently use your computer for]], this can become extremely handy.

## Overview of This Guide

[[AutoHotkey]] can do a lot of things. I will walk through only five of those things, because they are the functions I find most handy and use most often:

1.  Key rebinding 
2.  Custom keyboard shortcuts 
3.  Hotstrings 
4.  Custom right-click menus
5.  Keychords

I'll also walk through how I personally use [[AutoHotkey]] in my [[Personal Knowledge Management]] [[Workflow]]. Finally, I'll give you some snippets that you can use or adapt for your own purposes.

Here's an overview of this introduction's eight parts:

# An Introduction to AutoHotkey

For an answer to the question, "What is AutoHotkey?" see [[AutoHotkey]].

## Why Learn [[AutoHotkey]]?

Well, if your daily driver laptop or desktop computer is a Mac or runs some variant of [[Linux]], this is really easy to answer—**you shouldn't!** [[AutoHotkey]] is a Windows-only program.

But if your primary computer is a Windows machine, you should learn AutoHotkey because it will save you time by letting you automate keystrokes and mouse clicks. Depending on [[Workflow|what you most frequently use your computer for]], this can become extremely handy.

[[AutoHotkey]] can do a lot of things. I will walk through only four of them, because they are the functions I find most handy and use most often:

1.  Key rebinding 
2.  Custom keyboard shortcuts 
3.  Hotstrings 
4.  Custom right-click menus

I'll also walk through how I personally use [[AutoHotkey]] in my [[Personal Knowledge Management]] [[Workflow]].

Here's an overview of this introduction's six parts:

- [[Part 1: Getting AutoHotkey]]
- [[Part 2: Key Rebinding]]
- [[Part 3: Custom Keyboard Shortcuts]]
- [[Part 4: Hotstrings]]
- [[Part 5: Custom Right Click Menus]]
- [[Part 6: Using AutoHotkey for PKM]]

# Part 2: Getting Linux

If you want to learn Linux, the first step is to get Linux.

-   Places to Run Linux
    -   Linux is *everywhere*. It's easy to find an installation of
        Linux to tinker with.
    -   Install Linux on Dedicated Hardware
        -   An old (or new) laptop or desktop computer
        -   A small Single-Board Computer (SBC) like a Raspberry Pi
    -   Install Linux virtually inside of another Operating System 
        -   A Virtual Machine (VM) on Mac, Windows, or even another
            Linux install
        -   The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows 10/11
        -   An old (or new) Android smartphone
    -   Run Linux in the Cloud (a.k.a. some stranger's computer on the
        internet)
        -   Linode
        -   Google Cloud Compute
-   How to Get Linux
    -   Choose a "Distribution" of Linux
        -   Don't get scared by the fancy word—a "distribution" of Linux
            is just a slightly customized copy of core Linux with a
            selection of additional programs and tools.
        -   The biggest decision to make is whether you're going to run
            Linux in "text-only" mode, or whether you want to have a
            graphical interface too.
            -   "Text-only" mode is sometimes called "Lite," "Server,"
                or "Headless"
            -   "Graphical interface" means your distribution needs a
                "Desktop Environment."
        -   Beginner Options
            -   Installing on a Laptop or Desktop
                -   Advice
                    -   If you're installing Linux on a laptop or
                        desktop computer, there are dozens of options.
                        Here's a few good ones to start with—and don't
                        get anxious about this. Distros are usually +95%
                        the same as one another, and you can switch to a
                        new one any time you want to (so this isn't a
                        permanent choice).
                -   Text-only
                    -   Ubuntu Server
                -   GUI Included
                    -   Ubuntu (or for low-powered machines, Kubuntu)
                    -   Linux Mint
                        -   Pop!\_OS
            -   Installing on a Raspberry Pi
                -   If you're running a Raspberry Pi, the beginner
                    choice is obvious: Raspberry Pi OS.
                    -   To run text-only, pick the Lite version.
                    -   For a graphical interface, get the full version.
            -   Installing on WSL or a Cloud Provider
                -   If you're running the Windows Subsystem for Linux
                    (WSL), there are many distributions available. They
                    will all be text-only by default. Ubuntu is a great
                    starting choice.
    -   Download your distribution and follow the installation
        instructions.
        -   The most common way of installing: Live USB

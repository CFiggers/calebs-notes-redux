# What kinds of grinders are there?

Previous: [[How do I grind coffee beans myself?]]

Coffee grinders basically come in three types:

-   Spinning Blade Grinders
-   Hand-Held Burr Grinders
-   Electric Burr Grinders

### **Spinning Blade Grinders**

**Spinning blade grinders** are common and inexpensive, but the grounds
they produce are really inconsistent. This is because they essentially
work by "pulverizing" the coffee beans, producing a wide spread from
"fine" to "coarse" in the final grind. There isn't a way to control
consistency with a spinning blade grinderâ€”no matter how nice it is. I
don't recommend spinning blade grinders for most people trying to make
good coffee at home.

### **Hand-Held Burr Grinders**

Burr grinders are generally much more consistent than spinning-blade
grinders. Some burr grinders are hand-held and human powered. These
**Hand-held burr grinders** tend to produce high-quality grinds
(compared to spinning blades) and are comparatively inexpensive
(compared to electric burrs), but are slow and high-effort, because you
have to crank them yourself.

### **Electric Burr Grinders**

**Electric burr grinders** are consistent and quick (generally
speaking), but tend to be expensive (and sometimes really noisy). A
quality electric burr grinder will *start* around $150 and go up from
there, especially the more special features come baked in.

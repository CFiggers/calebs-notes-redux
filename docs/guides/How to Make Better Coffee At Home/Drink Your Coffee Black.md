# Drink Your Coffee Black

Previous: [[What to Spend Money On for Better Coffee]]

This last one is just for fun—making and drinking coffee is about **enjoyment.** So if you like cream and sugar, don't let me scare you off of it. 😉 I don't make fun of *anyone* for the way they prefer their coffee. That just feels mean-spirited and self-important to me. But I drink my coffee black, and here's some reasons why.

### **Why should I drink my coffee black?**

For one thing, flavored creamer and processed sugar are not good for
you! Sugar in particular is just unhealthy. And most flavored creamers
that you can get in the grocery store have *still more* sugar in them.
Every chance you can take to cut processed sugars out of your diet is a
chance you ought to consider. Without them, coffee is actually a very
narrowly *calorie negative* beverage—which means, you burn
ever-so-slightly more calories from processing the caffeine than the
coffee itself adds to your system.

But on a more serious note, if you've been following along with this
guide up to this point, then you've already put a ton of effort into
improving your coffee game. Covering up that coffee with creamer and
sugar sortof undoes all that work by preventing you from tasting the
difference anyway.

#### **But isn't coffee super bitter?**

All coffee is slightly bitter, yes! But most of the bitterness that most
people associate with coffee comes from tasting cheap or badly prepared
coffee. Coffee that is fresh, well-roasted, well-ground, and well-brewed
has tons of flavor that is not bitter at all—some people even find it
slightly "sweet" (not in a sugary sort of way, but with a subtle
fruit-like sweetness).

I like to drink my coffee black partly because my favorite creamer
flavor of all time went out of production and no creamer I've ever
tasted since has been as good. But partly, I drink it black so that I
get feedback on how well or how poorly I did my brewing this time
around. And sometimes, when my beans are especially old or I've done a
particularly iffy job on the brew, I'll add some sugar rather than waste
it (or suffer through a cup that just tastes horrible!).

# What to Spend Money On for Better Coffee

Previous: [[Find a Brew Method That You Like]]

### **So, how much does all of this cost?**

Depending on your [[Find a Brew Method That You Like|brew method of choice]],
making good coffee at home costs around $120-150 to get started (\~$50
for a quality hand grinder, \~$50 for brewing equipment, \~$20 for misc.
odds and ends—plus, of course, [[Get Good Coffee|the coffee itself]].

### **If I've got extra money and want to upgrade, where should I spend it?**

Aside from [[Get Good Coffee|the coffee itself]], the
number one place to spend is your **[[Grind Your Own Coffee Beans|grinder]]**.
Funnily enough, actually brewing the coffee is the easy part—as long as
you're getting the water hot enough, there's really not much that a more
expensive brewer will do for you that a cheap one doesn't (unless you're
into espresso—but that's a whole different topic!).

But improving the quality of your *grind* has all sorts of benefits:

-   Having a more consistent grind will make your brew more repeatable
    and more delicious by keeping more and more of the grounds in the
    "sweet spot" during brew. Bits that are ground too fine will
    over-brew and ones ground too coarse will under-brew, both of which
    add less pleasant flavors to the finished cup. A good grinder will
    reduce that.
-   In addition to making your coffee taste better in general, a better
    grinder will make high-end specialty coffee worth the price. If your
    grinder is poor, there's a limit to how much you'll benefit from
    expensive coffee beans. But if your grinder is consistent and your
    brewing process is "dialed in," then nicer coffee will actually
    change the way your brewed coffee tastes!

Aside from that, spend money on **conveniences**. Pick up an electric
grinder rather than a hand mill. Or get an electric grinder that runs
more quietly than your current one. Get an electric kettle with a better
pouring spout if making great pour-over is your goal. Or get one that
heats up faster, if your current kettle is lower-powered and takes
several minutes to get hot.

If you want to be really nerdy and scientific about your coffee, you can
look into **refractometers** to help objectively measure your finished
cup. But those can cost *hundreds of dollars* all on their own. So maybe
only check those out if you're trying to be a true professional.

# Find a Brew Method that You Like

Previous: [[Tailor Your Coffee Recipe to Your Brew Method]]

### **Why try different brew methods?**

You should try different brew methods for a few reasons:

1.  Every brew method tastes slightly different.
2.  Each brew method has advantages and disadvantages—so find the one
    that works best for your setup.
3.  Trying different styles of brewing coffee is tons of fun!

### **What brewing methods are there?**

As mentioned on the [[Tailor Your Coffee Recipe to Your Brew Method|Tailor Your Coffee Recipe]]
page, there are two basic brew methods: **percolation** and
**immersion**.

*Percolation* includes any brewing method where the grounds stay in one
place and the water runs through the grounds throughout the brew.
*Immersion* means any brewing method where the grounds and the water
hang out together for a while before you separate them.

Here's some examples of each:

-   Percolation
    -   Most simple electric coffee makers
    -   Pour-over
    -   Espresso (technically—espresso is complicated and kindof its own
        thing!)
    -   Most pod-based single-serve coffee makers (like Keurig and
        Nespresso)
-   Immersion
    -   French Press
    -   AeroPress
    -   Clever Dripper
    -   Cold Brew

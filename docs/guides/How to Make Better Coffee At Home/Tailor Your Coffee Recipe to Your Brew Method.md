# Tailor Your Coffee Recipe to Your Brew Method

### **Why do I need to tailor my coffee recipe?**

Well, strictly speaking I suppose you don't! But for maximally delicious
coffee, some tweaking always makes for a tastier cup.

Broadly speaking, there are two basic [brew
methods](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/find-a-brew-method-that-you-like-Ade2M08YJWev):
**percolation** and **immersion**. For *percolation* methods, you will
grind your coffee slightly finer and use slightly less of it. For
*immersion* methods, you'll grind slightly coarser and use slightly
more. These are both on average—each specific brew method has its own
needs.

### **What is a good coffee recipe to start with?**

Different people have different preferences when it comes to coffee.
Some like it stronger than others; some like more of it than others. You
really have to experiment to find something you like—I can't just give
you the exact ratio that will taste best to you!

But here's a good place to start: many coffee guides recommend brewing
at a **1:16 ratio.** That means however much coffee you're brewing with,
use 16x that much water. Here's some examples of how that stacks up with
real-world measurements (remember that we're [measuring coffee by
weight](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/measure-your-coffee-by-weight-vrJ0LrbPQdOp)):


|         | Coffee | Water (g) | Water (oz) |
|---------|--------|-----------|------------|
| 1 Cup\* | 7.5g   | 120g      | \~4 oz     |
| 2 Cups  | 15g    | 240g      | \~8 oz     |
| 3 Cups  | 22.5   | 360g      | \~12 oz    |
| 4 Cups  | 30g    | 480g      | \~16 oz    |


\* One "cup" of coffee equates to \~4 fluid oz.

Remember that **immersion** [brew
methods](https://calebsnotes.brick.do/find-a-brew-method-that-you-like-Ade2M08YJWev)
generally need a bit more coffee than percolation. If you're using an
immersion method, try switching to a 1:15 ratio instead.
